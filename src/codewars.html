    <p>1.Write a function that returns only the decimal part of the given number. You
      only have to handle valid numbers, not Infinity, NaN, or similar. Always
      return a positive decimal part.</p>
    <p>2.</p>
    <p>3.Given an array/list [] of n integers , find maximum triplet sum in the array Without duplications .</p>
    <p>
      4.Take an integer n (n >= 0) and a digit d (0 <= d <= 9) as an integer.
      Square all numbers k (0 <= k <= n) between 0 and n.
      Count the numbers of digits d used in the writing of all the k**2.
      Implement the function taking n and d as parameters and returning this count.
    </p>
    <p>5.Given an array of integers , Find the minimum sum which is obtained from summing each Two integers product .</p>
    <p>6.Complete the function power_of_two/powerOfTwo (or equivalent, depending on your language) that determines if a given non-negative integer is a power of two. From the corresponding Wikipedia entry:
      a power of two is a number of the form 2n where n is an integer, i.e. the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and integer n as the exponent.</p>
